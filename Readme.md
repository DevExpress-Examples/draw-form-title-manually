# How to draw a form title manually


<p>If you are using our XtraForm and title bar skinning feature is enabled (i.e. you call the DevExpress.Skins.SkinManager.EnableFormSkins method at application startup) you can custom draw a form's title. It can be done by creating a custom FormPainter and by overriding its methods.</p>
